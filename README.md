# Project Description

High-throughput sequencing technologies have helped researchers expand their understanding of genome-wide gene expression through their ability to detect potentially any mRNA molecule in a sample, rather than measuring only molecules with specific sequences as with microarrays. This agnostic approach to molecular profiling allows us to ask different and somewhat more complex questions of a sequencing dataset than a microarray dataset, (e.g. novel splice patterns, lincRNAs, coding mutations, etc), but the most basic information, mRNA abundance, is analogous to microarray expression measurements and extremely useful. In this project, you will download, QC, process, and analyze sequencing data that was generated to better understand how neonatal mice are able to regenerate their heart tissue but lose this ability later in development.
